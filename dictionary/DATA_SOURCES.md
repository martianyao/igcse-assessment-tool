```python
# Auto-generated pseudo questions for demonstration
sample_questions = {
    "topic": "2.4_ionic_bonding",
    "question": "Which property is characteristic of ionic compounds?",
    "options": [
        "A) Low melting points",
        "B) Conduct electricity when solid", 
        "C) Conduct electricity when molten",
        "D) Insoluble in water"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "difficulty": "medium",
